	<h1>Query 2: The trend between the age of each participant and how many medals they won was based 
	on each individual event and whether they were male or female </h1>


	<br />
	This trend analyzes the number of medals earned by different countries and regions split by gender.<br />
	The number of medals can be treated as an indication of a country's investments in its athletes and subsequently the 
	 general status of a country.<br /> With a growing economy, a country can invest more in such events and use the scores of its 
	 athletes to peacefully show its existence in the world, and vice versa. <br />
	 Steadily growing scores of medals over a certain time period usually reflect steady development of the country within this time.
