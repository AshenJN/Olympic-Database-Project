	<h1>Query 6: The trend of the least number of medals won at the Olympics every year</h1>

	<p style={{fontSize: "14px"}}>
	

</p>
This graph shows the least number of medals that have been won by a team every year however, this trend only considers teams that won 
at least one medal that is why the number zero does not appear.
<br />
 This graph gives a good indication of the amount of money that countries put into their Olympic teams and what was going on with 
 the war. 
 <br />
 In the first few games, the least number of medals won were 3 and 2 meaning that countries were investing a lot of money into their athletes,  <br />
 but as the great depression began in the late 1920s, you can see that teams were leaving with only one medal and towards the end of the great depression when world war II began the Olympics were not held since, 
 <br /> no points were plotted in the graph for this time.
