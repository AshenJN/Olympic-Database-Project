	Query 6 shows the trend of how BMI affects athletes performance in each event based on medal count.
</p>
We will calculate BMI using height and weight, then we will track BMI per event and try to discover if BMI has a positive or negative correlation, or no correlation at all. <br />
We will group people by the same BMI, and average the medal count for all persons with the same BMI in a particular event.
