        <p>

      The following ten graphs show how many medals each team has won each year, separated by the medal type,  
       <br />for the following teams: United States, Soviet Union (and Russia), United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, China, Sweden, Australia, and Japan.
       <br />  These graphs clearly depict how the country's economy at the time impacted how many medals they won and how the number has fluctuated over time.
       <br /> Although these are the top 10 in the year 2016, it is clear to see that this was not always the case.<br />
